                            The story of Rice King Express
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            The owners of Rice King Express are Jingyong Liang and Kunying Yan, and they have quite the
                            experiences of being in the culinary business. Their journey started working in different
                            fast food businesses in New York. But after 3-4 years they moved to Utah and started their
                            own business with many others, Fortune Buffet. The buffet didn’t run as planned, so they
                            quit and left the management to the others. After a few years the entire business was
                            closed, but the two of them already had plans. They decided to open their own restaurant,
                            Rice King Express. And after 20 years Rice King Express is still thriving in its current
                            location 3649 W 10400 S #106, South Jordan, Utah, 84095.
