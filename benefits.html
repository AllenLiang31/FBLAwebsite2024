                <p>
                    At Rice King Express we value inclusion. We believe that everyone regardless of backgrounds or
                    experience should feel like they are a part of our team. So we have a comprehensive training program
                    that can teach you lots of beneficial customer service and packaging skills, so no one feels left
                    out. We also understand that personal growth might vary and the paths you take in life will be
                    different, so many of the skills you learn here can also be transferred to other fast food places
                    which will make you feel ready and confident when it is time to say goodbye.

                    At Rice King Express a key value we have is food quality. We serve food not only for the experience
                    of our customers but also for the well-being of the community. We make sure to pick all the
                    ingredients we use and ensure that it is from ethical and sustainable practices. If you are
                    interested you can come with us to shop for ingredients and equipment every Sunday. This is a very
                    interesting process in which you will be able to learn where restaurants shop and what our thought
                    processes are when buying ingredients.
