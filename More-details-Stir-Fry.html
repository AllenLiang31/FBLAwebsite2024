            As the stir fry chef, your job is to follow recipes that will be taught to you while you are on the job. You
            will be making things like the Lo Meins, the Mixed Vegetable Deluxe, the Cashew Chicken, the Beef with
            Broccoli, and many other stir-fried foods. You will also be expected to help with cleaning up and
            collaborating with the fryer chef and the preparation chef in the kitchen.
